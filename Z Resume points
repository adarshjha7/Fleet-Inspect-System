**Complete Backend/Frontend Flow Explanation:**

**Architecture Overview:**
FleetInspect is a full-stack fleet management application built with React frontend and Express.js backend, designed for managing vehicle inspections and maintenance tracking.

**Frontend Flow (React + TypeScript):**
1. **Authentication Layer:** User logs in through protected routes, system validates credentials and establishes session with role-based access (Admin/Inspector)
2. **Dashboard Landing:** Main dashboard loads showing fleet statistics - total vehicles, inspection counts, recent activities via REST API calls
3. **Vehicle Management:** Grid view displays all vehicles with status badges (Pass/Fail/Pending), filterable by status, searchable by vehicle ID
4. **Inspection Workflow:** Multi-step form for conducting inspections - vehicle selection → inspection checklist → defect reporting → photo uploads → final submission
5. **Real-time Updates:** Dashboard automatically refreshes inspection counts and status changes using React state management and API polling
6. **Report Generation:** Users can view detailed inspection reports, filter by date ranges, export data, and track compliance history

**Backend Flow (Express.js + RESTful APIs):**
1. **Authentication Middleware:** JWT-based auth system validates user sessions and role permissions for each API request
2. **Vehicle Data Management:** CRUD endpoints handle vehicle registration, updates, deletion with data validation using Zod schemas
3. **Inspection Processing:** API processes inspection submissions, validates data integrity, stores results with timestamps and inspector details
4. **File Upload Handling:** Multer middleware processes inspection photos, stores them securely, and links to inspection records
5. **Report Generation:** Backend aggregates inspection data, calculates statistics, and formats reports for frontend consumption
6. **Database Operations:** SQLite/PostgreSQL integration for persistent data storage with proper indexing for performance

**Key Technical Implementations:**
- **State Management:** React Context API for global state (user auth, inspection data)
- **API Integration:** Custom hooks for data fetching with error handling and loading states
- **Responsive Design:** TailwindCSS with mobile-first approach and dynamic layouts
- **Data Validation:** Frontend form validation with backend Zod schema validation
- **File Management:** Secure image upload with preview functionality and compression
- **Performance:** Lazy loading components, memoization, and optimized re-renders

This creates a complete fleet management ecosystem where inspectors can efficiently conduct vehicle inspections while administrators monitor fleet health and compliance in real-time.

Data Storage Analysis:
❌ NO REAL DATABASE EXISTS - The app uses Browser localStorage as a pseudo-database!

File Storage Location:

Photos/Videos: Stored as Base64 encoded strings in localStorage
User Data: All stored in browser's localStorage with these keys:
fleet_vehicles - Vehicle information
fleet_reports - Inspection reports with embedded files
fleet_alerts - Maintenance alerts
Storage Limitations:

Total Limit: ~5MB localStorage quota
Per File: Max 2MB per image/video
Total Files: Max 8MB for all files combined
Auto-cleanup: Removes old reports when storage >80% full

Critical Issues:
🚨 NO REAL BACKEND: Only 2 dummy endpoints that return static JSON
🚨 NO DATABASE: All data vanishes when user clears browser cache
🚨 NO FILE STORAGE: Images stored as Base64 in localStorage (very inefficient)
🚨 NO AUTHENTICATION: Backend has no auth middleware
🚨 NO PERSISTENCE: Data doesn't survive browser refresh/cache clear
This is essentially a LOCAL-ONLY demo app with no server-side persistence!

Was this helpful?
Restore to this point
But I wanted a simpler db for it like sqllite,

cause I wanted it to be a little full stack application

Adarsh Jha
Thinking
The user wants to add SQLite database to the FleetInspect application to make it a proper full-stack application instead of using localStorage. This is a reasonable request since currently the app is just using browser localStorage which isn't persistent and doesn't work as a real backend.

I'll need to:

Add SQLite dependency
Create database schema and tables for vehicles, inspection reports, and maintenance alerts
Replace the localStorage-based dataStore with actual SQLite operations
Update the Express server to have proper API endpoints for CRUD operations
Update the frontend to use the new API endpoints instead of localStorage
Let me plan this:

Add sqlite3 dependency
Create database initialization and schema
Create proper API endpoints for:
GET /api/vehicles
POST/PUT /api/vehicles
GET /api/reports
POST /api/reports
GET /api/alerts
POST /api/alerts
Update the frontend to use these APIs instead of localStorage
Handle file storage properly (maybe save files to disk or keep base64 in DB)
Let me use TodoWrite to plan this out.

I'll help you convert this to a proper full-stack application with SQLite database! Let me plan this implementation.

Let's start by installing SQLite and setting up the database structure:

Now let's create the database schema and initialization:

-- FleetInspect Database Schema

-- Vehicles table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vehicles (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    bus_number TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pass', 'fail', 'pending')),
    last_inspection_date TEXT,
    odometer_reading INTEGER,
    model TEXT NOT NULL,

import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { join } from 'path';
import { Vehicle, InspectionReport, MaintenanceAlert, SerializedFile } from '@shared/fleet';

// Enable verbose mode for debugging
const Database = sqlite3.verbose().Database;

class FleetDatabase {
  private db: sqlite3.Database;

Build RESTful API endpoints for inspection reports CRUD operations
Build RESTful API endpoints for maintenance alerts CRUD operations
Update frontend to use API endpoints instead of localStorage
Handle file storage (photos/videos) - either file system or database BLOB
Now let's create the API endpoints for vehicles:

import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { fleetDB } from "../database/db";

// GET /api/vehicles - Get all vehicles
export const getVehicles: RequestHandler = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const vehicles = await fleetDB.getVehicles();
    res.json(vehicles);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching vehicles:', error);

import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { fleetDB } from "../database/db";

// GET /api/reports - Get all inspection reports
export const getReports: RequestHandler = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const reports = await fleetDB.getInspectionReports();
    res.json(reports);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching reports:', error);

import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { fleetDB } from "../database/db";

// GET /api/alerts - Get all maintenance alerts
export const getAlerts: RequestHandler = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const alerts = await fleetDB.getMaintenanceAlerts();
    res.json(alerts);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching alerts:', error);
